# Random Forest Classification

This is a scratch implementation of Random Forest ensemble method for classification. The dataset used is the famous Titanic dataset. The model takes in passenger details and classifies the passenger as a survivor or victim.

Random Forest is a parallel ensembling method where several Decision trees are made and their results are aggregated. Each Decision tree recieves a random sampled part of the dataset(with replacement). The features are sampled as well. The main aim of Rnadom forests is to reduce the variance when compared to that of a single Decision tree.

The main objective of this repository was to learn the Random forest algorithm rather than focus on accuracy. This is also my first kaggle competition! The model achieves a score of 0.7799 on kaggle.The language used was python.
