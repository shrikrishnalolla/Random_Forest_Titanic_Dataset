# Random Forest Classification

This is a scratch implementation of Random Forest ensemble method for classification. The dataset used is the famous Titanic dataset. The model takes in passenger details and classifies the passenger as a survivor or victim.

Random Forest is a parallel ensembling method where several Decision trees are made and their results are aggregated. Each Decision tree recieves a random sampled part of the dataset(with replacement). The features are sampled as well. The main aim of Rnadom forests is to reduce the variance when compared to that of a single Decision tree.
